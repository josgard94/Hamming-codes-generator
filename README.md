# Hamming-codes-generator
This repository contains the source code of the Hamming code generator that uses a generating matrix of Hamming 7 (Matrix H7)

Instructions
Text files are necessary for the proper functioning of the code generator.

1.- The file codes.txt contains the series of codes that will be protected against errors using the hamming encoder

2.- The hamming.txt file contains the codes generated when executing the hammingcode.py file.

3.- Finally, the text file named decoding.txt contains the result of executing the source code that corresponds to the hamming decoder.


Note: This implementation is able to recognize an error when decoding is performed and correct it.
